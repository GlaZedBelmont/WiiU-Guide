## Need for help

If you need help you can ask for it on the official [Homebrew Launcher](https://discord.com/invite/C29hYvh) server, in the **#wiiu-assistance** lounge.
Of course you have to ask in **English** ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

## What's a Homebrew?

> [!NOTE]
> Homebrew applications are custom, user-made software, which havenâ€™t been authorized by Nintendo.This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more.
>
> Homebrew can be run on your Wii U as long as you have a way to put files on an SD Card and your WiiU is updated to the latest version for your region.

A CFW is a firmware that allows you to run advanced applications on your WiiU. For example, this allows the installation of game editing.

**CFW** is only an abbreviation for **Custom Firmware**. This is the abbreviation that is used in the guide.
