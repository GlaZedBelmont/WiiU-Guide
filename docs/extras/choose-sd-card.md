# Choose SD Card

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to make a console backup before hacking it you need to know its capacity.
>
> - If your console has a capacity of 8 GB, you will need an SD card of 16 GB minimum.
> - If your console has a capacity of 32 GB, you will need a 64 GB SD card minimum.

> [!NOTE]
> There are different types of SD cards with different capacities.
>
> *Knowing that if you want to back up your console you have to increase the capacity.*
>
> - If you want to be able to install games, you will need at least a 32gb SD card (some games can go up to 20gb).
> - If you plan to play with mods, you need at least an 8 Gb SD card.
> - If you only want homebrew applications, without any mods, without installing games, a 4 GB SD card will suffice.
