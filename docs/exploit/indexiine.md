# Indexiine

> [!NOTE]
> Indexiine is a modified version of the `JSTypeHax` exploit. It was created by `Jonhyjp`.<br><br>
> They allow you to launch an exploit directly from the web browser without a wifi access point.<br>
> They replace the browser's base page with the index page that launches the exploit.

> [!DANGER]
> The steps in this tutorial are very important. If one of its steps is badly done, you can have a software brick.<br>
> This will completely block the web browser.

> [!NOTE]
> We are in no way responsible for bricks.

## Prerequisite

> [!NOTE]
> These measurements serve to avoid a potential software brick.

> [!WARNING]
> Before starting the tutorial, make sure that your home page is not the default one.

- #### Change the default browser page: {docsify-ignore}
To change the default page simply open any page.<br>
Without closing the browser, launch the mii channel, then close the mii channel, and that's it!

- #### Additional information: {docsify-ignore}
Be aware that you will modify the system browser, which means, if anything goes wrong, you might not be able to open the browser anymore, and considering that the browser exploit is the only way to restore the original browser files, you will have a SOFT-BRICK however, this soft brick will only brick you out of any homebrew content that needed CFW to be ran (and ran from the browser ofc), your original games will work regularly, but you wont be able to launch the system browser anymore.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial requires an advanced installation of the Homebrew Launcher with a working CFW.

> [!DANGER]
> The exploit requires the `payload.elf` file from the `JsTypeHax`. You can find it [here](https://static.wiidatabase.de/JSTypeHax-Payload.zip).<br>
> The file is in an archive, so you have to extract it. In this folder is a file named `payload.elf`, you have to move it to your SD card in the `WiiU` folder.
