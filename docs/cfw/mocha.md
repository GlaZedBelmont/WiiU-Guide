# Mocha CFW

`MochaCFW` is a **Custom Firmware** developed by `dimok789`.<br>
It's called **Â«freeÂ»** because it doesn't require a DS Virtual Game.<br>
Its only small flaw is that it has to be launched from the web browser and must be restarted each time the console is rebooted.

## Exploit

If you followed the tutorial correctly, you should have a Homebrew Launcher working.<br>
Now you have to choose what type of exploit you want to use.

- #### Online Exploit {docsify-ignore}

> [!WARNING]
> Requires an Internet connection every time you want to launch the Homebrew Launcher.

For more information on `Online Exploit`, you can [read our guide](online-exploit.md) on this subject.

- #### Indexiine {docsify-ignore}

> [!WARNING]
> Requires modifying system files.<br>
> Requires an internet connection to set up the exploit.

For more information on `Indexiine`, you can [read our guide](indexiine.md) on this subject.

## SD Preparation

If you followed the introduction, you must have already launched the Homebrew Launcher.<br>
But here's a little reminder.

You must have the following files:
- sd:/
    - wiiu
        - payload.elf
        - apps/
            - homebrew_launcher/
                - homebrew_launcher.elf
                - meta.xml
                - icon.png
            - appstore/
                - appstore.rpx
                - meta.xml
                - icon.png

So we're going to add MochaCFW.<br>
You can download it [here](https://www.wiiubru.com/appstore/zips/mocha.zip).

Then simply extract the archive to the root of your SD card.<br>
So you must have as files on your SD card:
- sd:/
    - wiiu
        - payload.elf
        - apps/
            - homebrew_launcher/
                - homebrew_launcher.elf
                - meta.xml
                - icon.png
            - appstore/
                - appstore.rpx
                - meta.xml
                - icon.png
            - mocha
                - mocha.elf
                - meta.xml
                - icon.png

## Customized launch image

If you have a custom launch image you can run it with MochaCFW if you place it in this folder:

```
sd:/ > wiiu > apps > mocha > launch_image.tga
sd:/wiiu/apps/mocha/launch_image.tga
```

## Autoboot

> [!NOTE]
> The autoboot of MochaCFW just avoids the Mocha menu when launching the application.

Once this option is enabled, a file will be created with the name `config.ini' and placed in the `sd:/wiiu/apps/mocha/` directory.

You can open the file with a simple text editor.<br>
It's going to give a result like this:
```
[MOCHA]
viewMode=0
directLaunch=1
launchImage=1
noIosReload=0
launchSysMenu=1
redNAND=0
seeprom_red=0
otp_red=0
syshaxXml=0
```

## Backup the NAND

- #### **What is the purpose of a NAND backup?** {docsify-ignore}

This can help unlock your WiiU if something has gone wrong. That's why nand backups are highly recommended.

- #### **Instructions** {docsify-ignore}

> [!NOTE]
> The NAND of your system can do either 8 GB or 32 GB (depending on the model). So your SD card must be larger. To know the capacity of your WiiU simply look at its color:
> - If the color is white then your console is 8 GB.
> - If the color is black then your console is 32 GB.
> 
> If your SD card does not have sufficient capacity, you can skip the MLC section.<br>
> The MLC section contains backup files and game data.<br>
> The MLC section is not required to recover most bricks.

> [!WARNING]
> Restoring a NAND backup **requires micro-soldering skills** and **additional hardware**.<br>
> **HOWEVER**, a NAND backup is **always useful**, so don't neglect it!<br>
> Your NAND backup is **unique** to your system. **Backups from other consoles will not work**.

To be able to copy your NAND, it will take several hours depending on the capacity of the console and requires an additional software: `Wii U NAND Dumper`. You can download it [here](https://www.wiiubru.com/appstore/zips/nanddumper.zip).

1. Extract the zip archive to the root of your SD card.
2. Plug your SD card into your WiiU and turn it on.
3. Launch the `Homebrew Launcher`.
4. Launch `MochaCFW`.
5. This will redirect you to the home menu, you just have to restart the exploit to go back to the home menu.
6. Launch `Wii U NAND Dumper`.
7. A configuration menu will appear, here is the recommended configuration:
   - Dump SLC: **yes**
   - Dump SLCCMPT: **yes**
   - Dump MLC: **optional**
   - Dump OTP: **yes**
   - Dump SEEPROM: **yes**
8. Press A to start the dump process. 
**The process will take time!**<br>

9. Once the dump process is complete, turn off your console then remove your SD card and plug it into your computer.
10. To make sure you donâ€™t lose the files, copy the slc.bin, slccmpt.bin, seeprom.bin, otp.bin and if you chose to go with a full backup, every mlc.bin.part file to your computer.
11. Delete the files from your SD Card to free up space.

## MochaCFW and its alternatives
MochaCFW alternatives are not real alternatives. They are modified versions adding other hacks. <br>
Here is the list of modified versions:
- MochaCFW + FSHax
- MochaCFW FAT32
- MochaCFW SD

#### **MochaCFW + FSHax** {docsify-ignore}

This modified version adds the `FSHax`. This modified version was designed to be able to execute hacks like `FTPiiu`.

#### **MochaCFW FAT32** {docsify-ignore}

MochaCFW FAT32 is used to add the possibility to use USB devices formatted in FAT32.

#### **MochaCFW SD** {docsify-ignore}

MochaCFW SD allows a certain application to access the SD card. This is useful for `TCPGecko` or even `SDGeckiine`.

## Mocha Payload

> [!NOTE]
> Mocha Payload is a modified version of the `payload.elf` file.<br>
> It was developed by Vincent-Coding (i.e. the creator of this guide ðŸ˜‰)<br>
> This program is based on `GaryOderNichts'` code.

They allow to launch `MochaCFW` directly, instead of `Homebrew Launcher`.<br>
This means that the `Homebrew Launcher` is inaccessible through the web browser. Therefore, you need to have the `Homebrew Launcher Channel` installed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to run MochaCFW twice, you have a chance to crash your console. Otherwise it will redirect you to the Mii Editor.

> [!WARNING]
> You must absolutely place MochaCFW in the following folder:
> ```
> sd:/ > wiiu > apps > mocha
> sd:/wiiu/apps/mocha/
> ```
> And the payload.elf file must be here:
> ```
> sd:/ > wiiu > payload.elf
> sd:/wiiu/payload.elf
> ```
